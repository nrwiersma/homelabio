Features:

* Power over Ethernet 802.3at (PoE+)
* NVMe SSD up to 2280
* HDMI
* USB-C UART communication on the front
* PWM fan

## Why

This is my first attempt at making a PCB and was largely a practical learning experience.

The schematic is heavily inspired by the [Raspberry Pi CM4IO](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm4io/cm4io-datasheet.pdf)
and the [HomeAssistant Yellow](https://github.com/NabuCasa/yellow).
